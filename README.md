# A telegram scanbot

Super basic telegram bot, just scans for keywords in one telegram group and notifies in another group if that keyword is picked up on.
Set the bot token in .settoken. In scanbot 'forwardChat = Set(["CHATID"])' set the Chat ID you want it to notify you in about keywords picked up on.
